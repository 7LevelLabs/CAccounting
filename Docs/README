CAccounting (Cloud Accounting) - it's for small businesses and freelancers.

The Idea is : keep your life easy.

Typical workflow is:

1. Create new invoice.
2. Send it to the customer (and automatic resend with a schedule).
3. Automatic reminds.
4. API.
5. Multilingual.

CAccounting operates in two flavors:
- SaaS (hosted solution) and
- Open Source for you (ready to build and launch on your servers).
